## Kotlin adoption

Interesting post from Crunch Tech: https://crunchtech.medium.com/the-impact-kotlin-had-at-crunch-in-just-one-year-15a586f84da2
where they saw reduction LOC when adopting Kotlin. ~10% in small codebases and upt to 20% for big ones.

Another post from doordash:https://careersatdoordash.com/blog/migrating-from-python-to-kotlin-for-our-backend-services/
where they chose Kotlin over go, Rust, Java and python3.

Google Home saw a 33% decrease in NullPointerExceptions:https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/fewer-crashes-and-more-stability-with-kotlin-b606c6a6ac04

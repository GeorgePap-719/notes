# Notes

This is a project where I am going to write about computer-science topics.
The main intention is to briefly describe my findings. I'll disregard any typos and will not obsess over a nice way to put something.

This work is research-heavy, and the findings are not often directly result or fit in a nice document.

Goals:
- Store findings that cannot be simply replaced by a link to a video, blog, post, etc.
- Transparency for my research side of work.
- Practice writing.
